# React createContext() and useContext()

### git@github.com:corumgold/react-module-4-demo.git

## Critical Concepts
1. Why would we want to use React Context instead of props?

2. How do we create a piece of React context for the first time (not in the return statement)? Where should we create it?

3. In the return statement in the component where context is being created, what component do we need to wrap around everything else in order to provide the context to the rest of the component tree?

4. What is the difference between useState and useContext?

5. In a component where we want to read from the context, how do we set up our code to read from context? (Outside of the return statement?)

6. In the return statement in the component reading context, how do we render the context value?

7. How can we incorporate state when creating  context?

8. How can we update our context value using the state management that we've incorporated?
